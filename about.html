                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <br />
                <p>I am a student at the University of Michigan, studying Computer Science in the College of Engineering. I am also double-minoring in Math and Entrepreneurship.</p>
                <p>My typical projects include those started for my own learning purposes or tools I have created to help myself in my own workflow. Game programming is also a personal hobby and I have been known to participate in Ludum Dare. You can find a full list of my projects <a href="projects.html">here</a>.</p>

                <h2>Skills and Experience</h2>
                <p>My work experience can be found on my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthew-edwards" target="_blank">LinkedIn profile</a>.</p>
                <p>I have been programming for over 9 years and my preferred programming languages include Java and C++, but I have solid experience in everything from ARM Assembly to PHP to Python to Swift. Below are a list of my skills:</p>

                <h2>Source Requests</h2>
                <p>For newer projects and finished projects, source code is usually available. Older or unfinished projects may have source code that is not uploaded to a website for easy access, but they are typically still under version control. If the project is listed on the website, I have access to its full source code. Source requests can be made to me through email.</p>
                <p>Source code for school projects is withheld to prevent breaches of the University of Michigan <a href="https://bulletin.engin.umich.edu/rules/">Engineering Honor Code</a>. Requests for school project source code should only be made by non-students.</p>
